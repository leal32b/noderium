# Quick Start

> Your first 10 minutes with Noderium—from zero to productive.

:::caution Work in Progress
Noderium is currently in **Phase 1** of development. Some features described below represent our **product vision** and are being actively developed. Currently available: **Markdown editor with syntax highlighting, keyboard shortcuts, distraction-free hide markers, and theme switching**. Features like AI-powered auto-organization and conversational retrieval are not yet available. Check our [Roadmap](/docs/introduction/roadmap) for the current status.

## The Aha Moment

Noderium is designed so you experience value in under 10 minutes. Here's what that journey looks like:

```
Download → Open → Capture First Note → See Auto-Organization → Talk to Your Knowledge
                                                                        ↓
                                                             "This actually works."
```

## Step 1: Open Noderium

When you first open Noderium, you'll see a clean, focused interface. No configuration wizards. No decision fatigue.

**What you'll notice:**
- A clean Markdown editor in the center (CodeMirror 6)
- A navbar with theme toggle (light/dark mode)
- A distraction-free writing experience

### Currently Available Features

The Markdown editor already supports:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Syntax Highlighting** | Full Markdown support including code blocks |
| **Hide Markers** | Markdown syntax markers are hidden when cursor is not on that line |
| **Keyboard Shortcuts** | `Cmd/Ctrl+B` (bold), `Cmd/Ctrl+I` (italic), `Cmd/Ctrl+E` (inline code) |
| **Theme Toggle** | Switch between light and dark modes via navbar |
| **Tab Indentation** | `Tab` key for indenting text |

---

## Step 2: Capture Your First Idea

Press `Cmd+K` (or `Ctrl+K`) to open the quick capture.

Type something simple:

```
AI will fundamentally change how we manage personal knowledge
```

Hit `Enter`.

**What happens:**
1. Your note is saved instantly
2. The system automatically detects this is an **insight** about AI and PKM
3. Tags are suggested: `#ai`, `#pkm`, `#trends`
4. Related topics are identified for future connections

**Time spent: ~5 seconds**

---

## Step 3: See the Magic (Auto-Organization)

Look at the sidebar. Your note appears, already organized.

- **No folder decisions** needed
- **No manual tagging** required
- **No taxonomy planning** upfront

The system understood what you captured and placed it appropriately.

**This is Pillar 2 (Invisible Organization) in action.**

---

## Step 4: Talk to Your Knowledge

Here's where it gets interesting. Instead of searching, you'll **talk** to your knowledge.

Open the conversation panel (`Cmd+Shift+K` or `Ctrl+Shift+K`).

Ask:

```
What have I learned about AI?
```

**The response:**
> Based on your notes, you've captured that "AI will fundamentally change how we manage personal knowledge." This suggests you're interested in the intersection of AI and PKM tools.
>
> *Source: [Your first note]*

**This is Pillar 3 (Conversational Retrieval) in action.**

---

## Step 5: Keep Going

Now capture a few more ideas:

1. **An article insight**: "The best teams share knowledge asynchronously"
2. **A task reminder**: "Research local-first sync solutions"
3. **A quote**: "Simple can be harder than complex" — Steve Jobs

Watch as:
- Each note is automatically organized
- Connections start forming (your graph grows)
- You can ask increasingly sophisticated questions

---

## What You've Experienced

In under 10 minutes, you've seen all 5 pillars working:

| Pillar | What You Experienced |
|--------|---------------------|
| **1. Minimum-Effort Capture** | `Cmd+K` → type → done (&lt;5 seconds) |
| **2. Invisible Organization** | Notes auto-categorized, no decisions needed |
| **3. Conversational Retrieval** | Asked a question, got a synthesized answer |
| **4. Ownership & Privacy** | All data stored locally on your machine |
| **5. Intentional Onboarding** | Productive in &lt;10 minutes, no setup |

---

## Pro Tips

### Capture Everywhere

- **Keyboard**: `Cmd+K` from anywhere in the app
- **Menu bar**: Quick access icon (coming soon)
- **Slash command**: `/capture` in any note

### Talk Naturally

Don't think in search terms. Ask questions like you would to a colleague:

- ❌ "negotiation tips" (search term)
- ✅ "How have I approached negotiations in the past?" (question)

- ❌ "meeting notes Q4" (search term)
- ✅ "What decisions did we make in recent meetings?" (question)

### Trust the System

- Don't create folders upfront
- Don't plan your taxonomy
- Just capture. The system handles the rest.

---

## Next Steps

Now that you've experienced the basics:

1. **Keep capturing** for a week—let your knowledge base grow
2. **Explore connections** in the graph view
3. **Ask deeper questions** as you accumulate more notes
4. **Read the [Vision](/docs/introduction/vision)** to understand the philosophy behind Noderium

## Common Questions

### "What if the auto-organization is wrong?"

You can always adjust. The system learns from your corrections. But you'll find it's right 95%+ of the time.

### "Where are my files stored?"

In a folder you choose (or the default location). All files are Markdown—open them in any text editor.

### "Is my data really private?"

Yes. Everything runs locally. No data is sent anywhere unless you explicitly enable cloud features.

### "Can I use my existing notes?"

Absolutely. Point Noderium at any folder of Markdown files. It will index and organize them automatically.

## The Philosophy

Noderium doesn't want you to learn a new system. It wants to:

1. **Reduce friction** so you capture more
2. **Handle organization** so you think more
3. **Enable retrieval** so you use more of what you know

Your job is to **think and create**. Noderium's job is everything else.
